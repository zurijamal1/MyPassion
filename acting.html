<h4> Acting and Film</h4>
    </div>
<div class="top-section">
<p>My passion is film and theater,
     and I am passionate about it because I love the art of storytelling through visual arts and being able to transport yourself to another world. </p>

<p>I was introduced to it by watching movies when I was younger, 
    especially Disney movies, and I wanted to be a part of a story or tell my own story through film. </p>

    <p> One of my main inspirations in the beginning was Disney 
        because I felt that their acting was cringey and I thought I could do better than them. </p>

        <p>The one who continues to inspire me is myself in the future.
             I imagine myself to be well off and happy in my career and my future, and I know I will achieve it, 
             so imagining myself where I am happy in what I do and is very satisfied with my life is enough to keep me going.
